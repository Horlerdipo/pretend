Welcome to the Pretend documentation.

Pretend is a Laravel package for user impersonation, built on top of Laravel Sanctum, designed to help admins step into the shoes of their users. With Pretend, you can securely impersonate a user, browse your app exactly as they see it, and debug issues or provide support without needing their credentials.

**Why Pretend?**

🔑 Sanctum-powered – integrates seamlessly with Laravel Sanctum’s personal access tokens.

🎭 True impersonation – experience the application from the user’s perspective.

🛡️ Secure by design – tokens, events, and middleware to keep impersonation safe and auditable.

⚡ Flexible storage – swap out the default database storage for your own implementation.
